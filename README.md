# Read Me Generator

## Description

In this project, I am creating a command-line application to generate a README file.

## Installation

npm install needed packages(inquirer)


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

In command-line type node index.js

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
